                                        <p>Thanks for checking out my blog, it is currently being worked on. My hardest past so far was using my machine locally to 
                                        <br>initialize the repository. Once I got the repo set up, I created a readme file with only a header.</         p>
                        
                                        <p>Then I added in a gitignore from the wrong directory somehow, so I had to go back and fix that later.
                                        <br> After  got those two files added locally, I pushed up to github. Once I had an understanding of adding, 
                                        <br>commit, pushing and pulling, I started to add a <strong>few extra files.</strong></p>       
                        
                                        <p>I've added an html document that I have been able to implement! I also added a few images from my computer just to test it out.
                                        <br> Finally I removed the wrong gitignore, and added the right one in the proper place, and updated the readme.</p>
                        
                                        <p>An <em>"aha"</em> moment I had was setting up the initial repository on my local machine. After I had the terminal properly configured,
                                        <br>I was able to move forward with gitupload, and from there started my blog. I think the coolest thing I've 
                                        <br>learned so far is the terminal commands, they can be used on almost any system.</p>
