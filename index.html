                        Thanks for checking out my blog, it is currently being worked on. My hardest past so far was using my machine locally to <br>initialize the repository. Once I got the repo set up, I created this readme file with only a header.<br>
<br>
<br>
                        Then I added in a gitignore from the wrong directory somehow, so I had to go back and fix that later.<br> After i got those two files added locally, I pushed up to github. Once I had an understanding of adding, <br>commit, pushing and pulling, I started to add a few extra files. 
<br>
<br>
<br>                  
                         I've added an html document that I have been able to implement! I also added a few images from my computer just to test it out.<br> Finally I removed the wrong gitignore, and added the right one in the proper place, and updated this readme.<br>
