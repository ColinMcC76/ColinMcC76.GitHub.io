                        Thanks for checking out my blog, it is currently being worked on. My hardest past so far was using my machine locally to initialize the repository. Once I got the repo set up, I created this readme file with only a header.<br>

                        Then I added in a gitignore from the wrong directory somehow, so I had to go back and fix that later. After i got those two files added locally, I pushed up to github. Once I had an understanding of adding, commit, pushing and pulling, I started to add a few extra files.<br> 

                        I've added an html document that I have been able to implement! I also added a few images from my computer just to test it out. Finally I removed the wrong gitignore, and added the right one in the proper place, and updated this readme.<br>
