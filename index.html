                        <p1>Thanks for checking out my blog, it is currently being worked on. My hardest past so far was using my machine locally to <br>initialize the repository. Once I got the repo set up, I created this readme file with only a header.</p1><br><br>
                        <p2>Then I added in a gitignore from the wrong directory somehow, so I had to go back and fix that later.<br> After i got those two files added locally, I pushed up to github. Once I had an understanding of adding, <br>commit, pushing and pulling, I started to add a few extra files.</p2><br><br>            
                        <p3>I've added an html document that I have been able to implement! I also added a few images from my computer just to test it out.<br> Finally I removed the wrong gitignore, and added the right one in the proper place, and updated this readme.</p3><br><br>
                        <p4>An "aha" moment I had was setting up the initial repository on my local machine. After I had the terminal properly configured, I was able to move forward with gitupload, and from there started my blog. I think the coolest thing I've learned so far is the terminal commands, they can be used on almost any system.</p4><br><br>
