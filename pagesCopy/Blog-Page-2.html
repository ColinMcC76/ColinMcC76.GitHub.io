                <h2>Prework Week 2</h2>
                <article>
                    <p>
                        Thanks for checking out my second week worth of work, this week 
                        I spent my time learning the fundementals of html and css. 
                        It has definitely been a challenging week, implementing 
                        skills I had literally just learned. But that is the 
                        exciting part about this bootcamp; learning on the fly.
                        My favorite part was adding in the nav bar on my top right corner,
                        that made my blog feel like it had more depth.
                    </p>
                    <h2>What are your thoughts on pseudo coding?</h2>
                    <p>I have some experience previously with pseudo coding. 
                        I took a class in computer science that didn't use 
                        computers... But it absolutely helped me with 
                        the process that goes into thinking about how to 
                        effectively write code the machine will implement correctly.
                        I understand that properly writing code helps with the 
                        end result, becuase theres a million ways to get 
                        the same result, but some are better than others. </p>
    
                    <h2>What are you struggling with?</h2>
                    <p>
                        I'm having trouble with CSS, but I'm sure with experience 
                        I will eventually get the hang of it. I'll have to look for 
                        more resources on it, or find a way to use the documentation 
                        and implent it in a live fasion, to see the changes. I'm  
                        open to any suggestions on CSS tutorials or training, because 
                        I had a hard getting getting the CSS Comprehension ID card 
                        finished, and I'm sure it could be better done.
                    </p>
                    <h2>What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</h2>
                    <p>
                        I am excited to continue to learn designing websites,
                        making my blog more personal was very fun. Learning more 
                        CSS and getting comfortable with it will only make 
                        my blog more animate and alive. Java will also be exciting to 
                        implement in the webpage, i'm intrigued to see next weeks work,
                        but hesitant because I'm weary with CSS at the moment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Aha" moments have been in short supply this week.. 
                        I was able to get through HTML with relative ease, 
                        but CSS has thrown me through the ringer. While I 
                        was able to finish all the assignments, I stumbled 
                        through the CSS without a true understanding of 
                        the work. Hopefully as I continueto work over the 
                        weekend I will have more of an understanding.
                    </p>
