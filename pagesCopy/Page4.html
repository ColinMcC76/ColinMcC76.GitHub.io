                <h2>What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing user experience?</h2>
                <p>
                    They all work in tandom with each other to produce the full experience for the user. With only html the page would be very basic, with only css you'd have style and design to the page but no content. Finally, Javascript executes all the script on the page so that he user will have a dynamic experience on the website. I'm excited to see how Javasript will continue to play an important job in our roles as a web developer.

                <h2>What are some objects that your blog incorporates?</h2>
                <p>
                    Right now I dont believe my page incorporates any objects at the moment. I'd like to add a live twitter feed embedded in my main page, along with a search bar, so I can searh through all my content in the page and find anything relative. I'd also like the make my nav bar sleeker and more modern with an eternal scroll function.
